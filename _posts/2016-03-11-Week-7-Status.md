# Project Status
This week, in class we had a few outside parties take a look at the wireframes that we created for each of our tasks last week. We had them give us feedback and suggestions for how to create a more user friendly interface. From these suggestions we created a cognitive walkthrough to outline how our users view our application.

# Cognitive Walkthrough
We used the usage outlined in our cognitive walkthrough to make edits to our original wireframes to make them more user friendly and in line with what our users are expecting out of our application.
